		<h1>Hello, World</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is Nithin Srinivasan and I'm a computer science student at the University of Washington. I am interested in machine learning and neural networks because I believe they have the power to solve some of humanity's most complex problems. Outside of the computer science, I enjoy playing basketball, working out and procrastinating my homework.</p>
		<h1>Projects</h1>
			<h2>Interpreter for a Java-like Language</h2>
			<p>Designed a weakly-typed language with all the constructs of a basic programming language like conditional blocks, loops, variables, constants, functions and recursion. This language was then passed to an interpreter written in python that would interpret the code and execute the desired functions.</p>
			<h2>Education Marketplace Mobile Application</h2>
			<p>I built an education marketplace mobile application to connect students with tutors, with the intention of launching a company. Its features include searching for tutors, scheduling classes and an in-app chat functionality. It was written using React Native framework and Google Firebase and version control using Git.I pitched the app at an entrepreneurship competition and won the ‘Best Business Model’ award.</p>
			<h2>Coronavirus Tracker App</h2>
			<p>I built a mobile app to visually track the global coronavirus pandemic. Its features include map view, country comparison, case graphs, and locality-based statistics. It was written in Dart, using Google’s Flutter cross-platform app framework. It made REST API calls to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker API to retrieve live data.</p>
